This repo contains the templates and Sass I wrote to generate [my portfolio](http://instamatique.com/portfolio) with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Of note are my modified Vimeo plugin (based on [this Jekyl Vimeo plugin](https://github.com/gummesson/jekyll-vimeo-plugin) and [this technique for fluid-width videos](http://css-tricks.com/NetMag/FluidWidthVideo/Article-FluidWidthVideo.php)) and my sweet flexbox layout, which uses [this set of Sass mixins](https://github.com/mastastealth/sass-flex-mixin).
