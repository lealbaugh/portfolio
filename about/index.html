<div class="about">
	<p>This is a curated selection of recent past work by me, Lea Albaugh.  I ("Lea") design and implement ("make") human interactions with the created environment ("things") in a variety of virtual and physical media.</p>

	<p> For more places to find me on the internet, visit <a href="http://instamatique.com/lea">instamatique.com/lea</a>; for work from the further past, check out <a href="http://instamatique.com/archive">instamatique.com/archive</a>.</p>

	<p>I made this site with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, and the code is available <a href="https://github.com/lealbaugh/portfolio">at my Github</a>.</p>
